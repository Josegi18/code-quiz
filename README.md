Code Quiz Webpage



## Description

The Code Quiz Webpage was created with the purpose of providing the user a way to test his/her knowledge on JavaScript coding. The user will have 60 seconds to answer four  questions. After all four questions are answered, the user will be able to see his/her score and saved it to the brwoser local storage.

By working on this project, I learned how to use the JavaScript code to modify the html document, change styling and saving data to the local storage.
